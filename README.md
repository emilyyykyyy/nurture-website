# Nurture
Nurture is my group's final website deliverable for Kode with Klossy's Web Development course for Summer 2023! Nurture is an interactive website where individuals can find various mental health resources, such as calming music, meditation, yoga, etc. The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make our vision come to life!
